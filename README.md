# CtCI-JS

Javascript implementations of the data structures, algorithms, techniques and exercises presented in the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

I'm pushing code as I progress studying the book. The exercise solutions are not yet optimized and some I still need to work on!

Currently ending Chapter 6 / beginning Chapter 8
